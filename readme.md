# FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certificate

This repository is dedicated to the projects and exercises for the Front End Development Libraries Certificate from FreeCodeCamp. It contains all the necessary code and documentation to complete the certification.

In addition to serving as a resource for obtaining the certification, this repository also functions as a refresher course so I could revisit and strengthen my front end development skills.

I will also be creating other repositories for Backend Development and DevOps. These repositories will contain projects, exercises, and documentation to help in obtaining certifications and enhancing skills in those areas as well.
